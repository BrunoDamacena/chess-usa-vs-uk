# Chess: USA vs the UK
So, I programmed Stockfish 15 to play against itself. The only caveat is that one player is USA (starts without rooks) and the other one is UK (starts without a Queen). This means the USA doesn't have the capability of castling.

This code in Python goes through 200 games, 100 where the USA plays the white pieces, and another 100 when the UK plays the white pieces. The goal is to see who is stronger.
